## Lab 3: Collective Edits
The following lab is a group project to be completed with you 2D game design group. The lab will be graded pass fail and everyone in the group will receive the same grade. Work together!

Please create a Github Repository that:
- Lists each group member as a collaborator
- Each collaborator should make one commit to the repository. (One set of edits/changes)

Submit the link to the repository page on blackboard.

This repository can (and probably should!) evolve into your 2D game repository. Getting this workflow established will really help you with that project.
