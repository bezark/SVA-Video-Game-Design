# Capstone Game Project

For this project you may work in self selected groups or individually.


#### Objective:
Design and create a game that can be played and completed within a 10-15 minute timeframe. Your game should be engaging, embody clear objectives, and provide an enjoyable experience for players.

#### Constraints:
- **Beginning middle and end:** The game should be a concise yet engaging experience and MUST have a clear ending condition.
- **Clear Objective:** The game must have a well-defined objective, providing players with a clear goal or set of goals.
- **Rule-set:** Incorporate a simple yet effective set of game mechanics and rules that are easy for players to understand and interact with.

#### Submission Requirements:
- **Conduct a playtest on 12/9:** Conduct an in class playtest of your game on the last day of class
- Publish your game on Itch.io

#### Grading Criteria: (Total 30 Points)
- **Meeting stated design goals (0-5):** Does the game have a clear objective, perspective(character/world/universe), ending condition and emotional impact?
- **Tutorial (0-5):** Does the game itself teach players how to play it? When conducting in class playtests, you will not be allowed to explain how to play the game, so make sure players can learn how to play the game just by interacting with it.
- **Robust(0-5):** Can the game run from beginning to end without crashing? If analog, are the rules for the game airtight- can players play the game from beginning to end just by reading the rulese.
- **Polish (0-5):** Spending a little extra effort on visuals, sounds or Juice can go a long way!
- **In-class Playtest + 5:** 5 points for having a playable prototype on the final day of class
- **Publishing to Itch.io +5:** 5 Points for successfully publishing your game on itch and submitting it that way. For analog games, consider creating digital 'print and play assets'

#### Tips for Success:
- **Begin with Basics:** Start with simple game mechanics and gradually add complexity. Remember, a well-executed simple game is better than a complex one that's unfinished or unplayable.
- **Iterative Design:** Utilize playtesting feedback to refine gameplay and mechanics. Don't be afraid to make changes based on player experiences.
- **Utilize Godot Resources:** Take advantage of Godot's documentation, tutorials, and community forums to overcome technical challenges.
- **Collaborate and Communicate:** Work closely with your group members, dividing tasks based on skills and interests, and maintain open lines of communication throughout the project development.
